NAME

  delimit - delimits text files using a format file

SYNOPSIS

  delimit (options)

DESCRIPTION

  delimit is designed to read each record containing fields from a text file and
  insert delimiters between each field. delimit can reformat each field using
  filter actions defined in a format file where each line in the format file
  must contain the field size, field filter action and field name for each field
  in the input text file.

  The following options are available:

  -f  [format file name]
  -i  [input file name]
  -o  [output file name]
  -c  use comma field delimiter
  -t  use tab field delimiter
  -x  use space field delimiter
  -s  use single quote delimiter
  -d  use double quote delimiter
  -u  [unique delimiter (0x00 hexadecimal number)]
  -r  report statistics
  -w  enable write over input file as output mode
  -h  display usage

  An unique delimiter must be represented as a hexadecimal number and must be
  represented in 0x00 format (for example: the line feed character is 0a).

DELIMIT FORMAT FILE

  Each line in the format file must be contain the following:

  <field size> <field filter action> <field name>

  Field filter actions can be either:

  o  -             no action
  o  alphabetic    allow alphabetic characters only
  o  alphanumeric  allow either alphabetic characters or digits (0-9) only
  o  numeric       allow digits (0-9) only
  o  printable     allow printable characters only
  o  remove        remove field
  o  spaces        replace field with space characters
  o  "string"      replace field with this string
  o  null          null field (zero length)

  Field name can be either:

  o  -             no field name
  o  "field name"  field name

  delimit requires the following syntax rules for each format file line:

  o  each command statement must be terminated with a new line
  o  each keyword be separated by at least a single white space
  o  each keyword must be lower case only
  o  each quoted string must be enclosed in double quotes
  o  each comment line must begin with the pound symbol
