NAME

  delimit - delimits text files using a format file

SYNOPSIS

  delimit (options)

DESCRIPTION

  delimit is designed to read records containing fields from an input text file
  and insert a character delimiter between each field when writing the records
  to another text file.

  delimit can reformat each field using filter actions as defined in a format
  file where the format file must contain the size, filter action and name for
  each field in the input text file.

OPTIONS

  -f <format file name>
  -i <input file name>
  -o <output file name>
  -c use comma field delimiter
  -t use tab field delimiter
  -x use space field delimiter
  -s use single quote delimiter
  -d use double quote delimiter
  -u <unique delimiter (0x00 hexadecimal number)>
  -r report statistics
  -w enable write over input file as output mode
  -v display version
  -? print this usage

  An unique delimiter must be represented as a hexadecimal number and must be
  represented in 0x00 format (for example: line feed character is 0x0A).

FORMAT FILE

  Each line in the format file must be contain the following:

  <field size> <field filter action> <field name>

  Field filter actions can be either:

  o  -             no action
  o  alphabetic    allow alphabetic characters only
  o  alphanumeric  allow either alphabetic characters or digits (0-9) only
