NAME

  delimit - delimits text files using a format file

SYNOPSIS

  delimit (options)

DESCRIPTION

  delimit is designed to read each record containing fields from a text file and
  insert delimiters between each field. delimit can reformat each field using
  filter actions defined in a format file where each line in the format file
  must contain the field size, field filter action and field name for each field
  in the input text file.

  The following options are available:

  -h  display options that are interpreted by delimit
  -f  format file
  -i  input file
  -o  output file
  -r  report statistics
  -w  write over mode
  -v  display version
  -s  single quote delimiters
  -d  double quote delimiters
  -c  comma field delimiters
  -t  tab field delimiters
  -x  space field delimiters
  -u  unique delimiter (0x00 hexadecimal number)

  An unique delimiter must be represented as a hexadecimal number and must be
  represented in 0x00 format (for example: the line feed character is 0a).

DELIMIT FORMAT FILE

  Each line in the format file must be contain the following:

  <field size> <field filter action> <field name>

  Field filter actions can be either:

  o  -             no action
  o  alphabetic    allow only alphabetic characters
  o  alphanumeric  allow only either alphabetic characters or digits (0-9)
  o  numeric       allow only digits (0-9)
  o  null          null field (zero length)
  o  remove        remove field
  o  spaces        replace field with space characters
  o  "string"      replace field with this string

  Field name can be either:

  o  -             no field name

  o  each keyword be separated by at least a single white space
  o  each keyword must be lower case only
  o  each quoted string must be enclosed in double quotes
  o  each comment line must begin with the pound symbol
